# Revirt

Just another reddit client. This project is being made with the power of ReactJS and NextJS.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/elfennani/reddit-client-nextjs.git

$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### In case of needing to run the production build (Better performance):
```console
$ npm run production
```

In need to run storybook(Currently not working because many of the components were deleted):

```console
$ npm run storybook
```
